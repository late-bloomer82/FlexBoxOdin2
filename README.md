# FlexBoxOdin2

Lessons learned from this project.


1. My approach to this project was disorganized and not structurd well, although this is fine since this is my first second project. That said, I need to implement a structured and systematic approach for my next projects to be more efficient and have a better result.

2. Lack of commits.

3. Code is not clear, needs to have more, better and more useful comments.

4. Class names are questionnable, they need to be more meaningful and have more clarity.

5.Obviously, code could be more efficient.


and ye.. thts pretty much it. I may of missed something.
